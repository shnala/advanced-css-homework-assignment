# <Shawn Analla Coding Portfolio>
## Description
This is a WIP home page for my online portfolio. It currently lacks functionality and content, mainly due to a lack of actual projects that I can link to; but these will  be added later, as they come. I plan on having this web page serve as a directory for the coding projects that I am most proud of--this home page in and of itself being one of my first. This is among my first attempts at creating a functional HTML/CSS live site and I have learned a lot (and have much to learn yet) about how to manipulate such elements into something I can be happy with. 


## Installation
Site is live at:
(https://shnala.github.io/advanced-css-homework-assignment/)

## Usage

## License
Not sure if I need a license for a portolio page?
